# How to Contribute

First, thank you for interest in contributing to NASA's Planetary Data System! The following document aims to get new people the all the information necessary for making contributions to the PDS.
If you find something that would be helpful to add please open a pull request!

## Code of Conduct

We at PDS pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We expect all contributors and community members to do the same. The [PDS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) defines these expectations along with information on how to report unacceptable behavior.

## Getting Started

We maintain the [Getting Started with PDS EN](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Getting-Started-with-PDS-EN) page with information helpful to people new to the PDS Engineering Node.

## Development

PDS EN software spans a number of domains and languages. We attempt to follow industry best practices relevant to each project while also maintaining consistency across the organization. Each repository maintains a README with instructions specific to that project's development practices. This includes instructions on build processes, testing, and software support tooling. Default templates are present for issues and pull request formatting to assist with those processes. Additional information can be found in our [Developer Guides](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Developer-Guides).

#### Committing Changes

For commit message best practices, the PDS tries to follow these [Github Commit Messages Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) where possible. Once you have read through the guidelines, check out our [commit message best practices](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Git-and-Github-Guide#commit-message-best-practices) for additional notes.

#### Issues

The PDS uses the [Naming Guide for Task, Bug, and User Story Titles](https://stratejos.ai/blog/naming-task-bug-user-story-titles/) article for echance and bug issue creation best practices. Additionally, check out our [Issue Tracking](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Issue-Tracking) page for further explanations.
