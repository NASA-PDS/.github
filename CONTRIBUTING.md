# üë• Contributing

When contributing to this repository, first off, a moment of gratitude: üôè Thanks for wanting to help out!

Whether submitting a bug report, making a pull request, asking for a new feature, or fixing some documentation, these are all _contributions_. Please review these guidelines in order to make your contribution shine!

-   **Is it a security vulnerability?** If so, please check out our [security policy](../SECURITY.md).
-   **Is it a bug?**
    -   Check the issue tracker to see if it's already been reported or if something similar's been reported.
    -   If you can't find it, submit a new issue using the "bug" issue type.
-   **Is it a code patch?**
    -   Open a new GitHub "pull request" with your patch.
    -   Make sure you describe the problem you're addressing (include links to issues if you can) and the solution you're proposing.
-   **Is it a cosemtic change, such as to code formatting, white space, etc.?** We generally don't use these kinds of contributions.
    -   Cosmetic changes create unnecessary work in reviewing them as well as noise in the commit history.
    -   They also make backporting bugs a lot more difficult.
-   **Is it a request for a new behavior or new feature?** Submit an issue using the "new feature" issue type.
-   **Is it a question about the code?** You can [send us email](mailto:Jordan.Padams@jpl.nasa.gov).

Once again, thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
