# üåå NASA Planetary Data System (PDS)

Welcome to the **NASA Planetary Data System (PDS)** GitHub organization ‚Äî  
the home for open-source software that powers NASA‚Äôs planetary science data archiving, management, and discovery ecosystem.

PDS serves as the **official archive for all NASA planetary mission data**, ensuring long-term preservation, accessibility, and usability for the global science community. This organization hosts the tools, services, standards, and infrastructure that enable that mission.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **PDS Engineering Node (EN)** at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) leads the design, development, and integration of the PDS software ecosystem, in collaboration with NASA‚Äôs discipline nodes and international partners.  
Our software and standards form the foundation for the **Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE)** and the evolving **Planetary Data Cloud**.

### Core Principles

- **Open Science** ‚Äî All tools and standards are open-source, publicly developed, and freely accessible.  
- **Interoperability** ‚Äî Built on the PDS4 Information Model, enabling consistent metadata and seamless data integration.  
- **FAIR Data** ‚Äî Ensuring data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  
- **Automation & Cloud Readiness** ‚Äî Designed for scalable, cloud-native operations and efficient data workflows.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Planetary Data Cloud

The **Planetary Data Cloud (PDC)** is our next-generation architecture hosted on AWS.  
It unifies data access, registry, and analysis services into a scalable, interoperable platform.

Core services include:
- **Registry** ‚Äî Centralized metadata catalog with federated search.
- **Data Upload Manager** ‚Äî Streamlined submission workflows for missions and nodes.
- **Nucleus** ‚Äî Workflow and data pipeline orchestration.
- **PDS API** ‚Äî Standard REST API for all data discovery and access.

## üß™ Developer Guidelines

We follow modern software engineering practices across all repositories:

- **Branching & CI/CD** ‚Äî Feature branches, pull-request reviews, automated builds via GitHub Actions.
- **Testing** ‚Äî Unit, integration, and regression tests required for all PRs.
- **Documentation** ‚Äî Every service and tool includes usage docs and API specs.
- **Releases** ‚Äî Managed through [GitHub Projects and Milestones](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-PDS/projects); see `releases/current` for the latest system build.

See [`copilot-instructions.md`](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/copilot-instructions.md) for PR review standards.
